# Building a POSIX-Compliant Shell from Scratch



## The Challenge

As a passionate systems developer, I took on the challenge of building a POSIX-compliant shell from the ground up. This project isn't just about creating another shell â€“ it's about deeply understanding how command interpreters work at their core and having fun.

## What I Built

My implementation includes:
- A robust command interpreter capable of parsing and executing shell commands
- Support for external program execution with proper process management
- Built-in command implementation (cd, pwd, echo, and more)
- A clean, interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) interface

## Key Learning Points

Throughout this project, I've gained deep insights into:
- Shell command parsing and lexical analysis
- Process creation and management in Unix-like systems
- Implementation of built-in shell commands
- REPL design patterns and best practices

## Try It Yourself

If you're intrigued by this project and want to tackle a similar challenge, I highly recommend checking out [codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io). Their platform provides a structured approach to building complex systems from scratch.

## Technical Details

I'll be adding more information about the implementation details, architectural decisions, and interesting challenges I faced during development. Stay tuned!
